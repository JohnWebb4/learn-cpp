# Part 11: Chars

- ASCII is very basic and only 1 byte
- UTF-32 is the standard. Encompasses most languages. 4 bytes.
- UTF-32 supports ancient languages, symbols and mathematical scripts.
- Reduced versions of UTF-32 are UTF-16 and UTF-8. To include what most people need.
  - 1 UTF-8 is ISO-8859 (ASCII)
  - 1 UTF-16 is Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Most modern languages
  - Reduced versions support chaining. 4 UTF-8 chars can represent all UTF-32. 2 UTF-16 represent all
    - Chaining uses 1.5 times more memory. If you may need UTF-32, use that.
