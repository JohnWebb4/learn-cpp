# Part 8: Floats

- Avoid `long double`. Format and size depends on OS.
- Float consts always include the decimal
- Float is 4 bytes. Double is 8.
- Rough estimate: Precision is twice the number of bytes. Float: 8 and Double 16
- Just use double unless you really care.
- Inf and NaN exist for floating point arithmetic
