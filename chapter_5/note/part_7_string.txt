# Part 7 String

- C strings have a lot of memory issues
- C++ std::string was added to better manage memory
- std::string makes a copy and is very expensive every time it's copied
- Passing a std::string by value to a function is a very bad idea
- std::string_view was added to borrow a read only version of strings
- Prefer std::string_view for readonly parameters. You must understand the lifetime of the underling string
- Prefer string for return types. Move semantics make life easier
